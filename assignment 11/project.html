        <dt>Description:</dt>
        <dd>The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, 
            objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data 
            over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The definition of the 
            Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine 
            learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor 
            networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to 
            enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining 
            to the concept of the "smart home", covering devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home 
            security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be 
            controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.</dd>
