      <p style="font-size: 25px; color:indigo;"><strong>SOUTH Bangalore</strong> promises a wonderful offer of cultural festivities, traditional cuisine and captivating sights. With a population of more than 8.5 million, Bangalore is not only an industrial hub, but also a very sought after destination for those who wish to add a little spice to their trip.  
        Hop on a bus and visit some of the places we recommend in SOUTH Bangalore. The Shiv temple, which symbolizes great faith, welcomes travelers from around the world to visit the pristine shrine of Lord Shiva and Lord Ganesha, revered by hundreds in the city and maintained under the RVM Foundation. One of the very few temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, this holy site is a religious space located on the Old Airport Road that was built back in 1995. With its towering presence, filled with sacred prayers, the temple is a beautiful architectural wonder visited by 400,000 
        devotees each year, especially during Shivratri, a popular Hindu festival.</p>
